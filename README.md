# Power Pi Project README

Welcome to the Power Pi project repository!

## Overview

This project aims to analyze sales data using Power BI, applying various data analysis techniques to gain insights into sales performance.

### Data Preparation

- Utilized Power Query to clean the data:
  - Removed duplicates and null values.
  - Ensured consistent data types.
- Created an ID column using unique values of the product name for easy data connectivity.

## Analysis

### Key Metrics and KPIs

- Analyzed sales data using DAX measures.
- Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) for sales.

### Visualizations

The analysis is visualized through various pages:

1. **Main Page**
   - Contains general information about the data.
   - Provides an overview of sales performance.

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.
   - Ensured uniform data types across columns.
   - Removed duplicates and null values.
   - Created an ID column using unique values of the product name.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Examined the distribution of key variables such as sales, order quantity, and pricing.
   - Identified outliers or anomalies in the data.

3. **Sales Analysis**
   - Analyzed sales performance over time using time-series analysis techniques.
   - Investigated sales trends for different product categories and subcategories.
   - Explored regional variations in sales.

4. **Key Insights and Recommendations**
   - Identified top-selling products or categories.
   - Highlighted areas for potential improvement or optimization.
   - Provided actionable insights for stakeholders based on the analysis.
